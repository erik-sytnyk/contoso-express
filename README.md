# Contoso Express

Full-stack JavaScript sample app. Remake of famous Microsoft Contoso University tutorial. This project provides many basic infrastructure parts, required in modern Web Application such as:

- project structure
- data access
- error handling
- logging
- configuration
- client side as SPA (Single Page App)
- unit testing
- etc

## Missing tutorial

A good thing about the node is that you have flexibility to build your own stack, the bad thing is that you have no other choise. There are no frameworks which will get you all you need, so you have to build our own foundation.

This project is the missing manual (sample) which shows one of the ways to build common infrastructure. That is good starting point if you are getting familiar with Node, as you do not need to do everything yourself.

## Get started

See instructions here: [Getting Started](https://github.com/yegor-sytnyk/contoso-express/wiki/Getting-started)

## Technologies

- Language: TypeScript (alt JS)
- DB: PostgreSQL (alt MongoDb)
- Data Access: Sequelize
- ExpressJS
- Logging: winston
- Validation: Joi
- Build: npm scripts
- Client render: React (alt Vue.js)
- Client data: Redux
- Client build: webpack

\*\* ALT - means alternative implementation is planned. For some areas it is hard to choose the best option, so would be nice to have alternative sample.
